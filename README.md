[Demo app](https://vporton.github.io/future-salary/)

It was [proposed](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/8183) to integrate this project into [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co).

See [this file](TODO) for things to be done. The most hard and important is to test and audit the smart contracts extensively. Consider volunteering for this project.
